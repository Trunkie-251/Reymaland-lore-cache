# Spacers:

They say that spacer blood is inhuman, entirely ice-cold... Not a drop of kindness and remorse in those cold stares they give you. And you know what? 'They' are right. Right on the goddamn money.

Spacers are fucking freaks. They're cold and indifferent to our struggles on the dirt of a million worlds, at times they're entirely *antagonistic*, preying upon groundside targets in savage raids using their brutally advanced technology. Something about only 'mature civilizations' living out in zero-gravity and groundsiders being little more than animals.

Animals. Hah, animals. That's the one thing that they're wrong about. Dead wrong.

They call us inferior, horribly muscled creatures, and what..? A good punch to the torse, and their ribcage shatters completely from the lack of bone density. The force of gravity on a planet is so great that their bones start slowly fracture and break under the weight of the world. Spacer immune systems are so used to the sterile, almost clinical environments of their orbitals and voidships, that even the lightest of infections and diseases can kill them without medical intervention.

No wonder why they pride themselves on their 'universal panacea', the autoimmune implant.

There's no way to cut your connection to the hated soil, our planetary mothers. The more they try to hold out with increasing reliance on technology, the more they seal their own fates of being bound by it.
