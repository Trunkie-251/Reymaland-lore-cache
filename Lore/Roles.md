# Roles:

### Dog Soldiers

The human soldiers of the Empire. They are augmented with basic cybernetic implants and given plasteel carapace armour. It is they who fight against the enemies of the empire. They are the meat that which goes into the meatgrinder.

They range from being frontline soldiers, to vehicle drivers, to artillerymen, logistics officers, engineers, etc. They are by far, the most numerous of the empire's forces.

They are named for their skull-mask which has an appearance similiar to a dog's skull. Variants of the gasmask change depending on the job or variant, but in the end, they all wear skull-like gasmasks.

### Thallax

A specific variant of dog soldiers, the Thallax is an extensively augmented human officer with a cybernetically interfaced 'limbsuit', a cybernetic suit with prosthetic limbs, which one needs to be amputated to interface with.

The Thallax serves as a form of commissar for the dog soldiers, leading human warriors into the frey, but also serving discipline where it is needed.

Thanks to their extensive augmentations, a Thallax is fully capable using heavy weapons without impairment.

### Inquisitor

Travelling agents of the empire who answer to no-one *save* for the Empress herself. Planetary Administrators, Admirals, generals, etc have no sway over the actions of these inquisitors.

Their purpose is simple; Ensure that subsectors and various officials, etc are following the rule of the empire, and paying tithe.

Inquisitors tend to wear thermoptic camo woven into their outfits and armor, allowing them to easily blend into the background of an environment.

### Warmistress/Warmaster

A noble who rules over a small sector of space and surface-territory, commanding the forces within as a sort of 'lord commander'. As with the rest of the empire, nobles are in their for their cleverness and talents... Most of the time.

A Warmistress is expected to fight for their in-system overlords and donate troops, resources, and infrastructure for the greater harmony of the house's warmachine at any given time.

A Warmistress is *exclusively* lizard, save for those from House ???.

### Tactician

A higher-ranking lizard(sometimes synthetic, and rarely human) officer who strategically plans, and commands military forces. Think two-parts intelligence officer, one-part commander.

These tacticians are responsible for planning campaigns and logistics, serving a critical role in a house's warmachine.

### CORE

A CORE is a synthetic intelligence core that is installed in many high-importance installations. It is essentially is an overlord over the many machines, especially those that house technicians may not have the knowledge to run or use.

It oversees the synthetics used on the station and lords over them, as with other synth technologies that the station runs on; as the house technicians my have little to no idea the esoteric sciences or components that go into these.
