# Sagaru Fiction:

When man first colonized the stars around himself, he chose to spread the grain of humankind far and wide to a variety of worlds beyond. Some were barren wastelands whom needed to be terraformed by either simple machines, or by the colonists themselves, while others were lush alien nightmares.

The Sagaru are an interesting case; While all groundsiders can be seen as rather 'primitive' and undeveloped, none of them are quite literally 'animals', like the Sagaru. A rather 'interesting' genotype that was meticulously engineered for colonizing planetary environments.

Crude, brutish, and tall, these earthbound peoples are. Large muscles and savagely dense bones make up their musculoskeletal systems, almost like a parody of grounside bodies. A thick coat of fur, and a curved, round... Yet angular and sharp muzzle serves as the face.

The eyes can see near-perfectly in the dark, up to matching some of our best nightvision nano. Digestive system and other organs are likewise, extremely robust.

Afterall, they can digest raw meat— Even commit acts of cannabalism with no ill effect. 

Ironically enough, this means on those devolved feral worlds which were colonized by sporeships oh-so-long ago, Sagaru do not develop civilization. They have no need for fire,  as their ability to digest raw meat as if it were cooked. And thus, they never discover metalworking nor agriculture. Apex predators cursed to be at the lowest stage of a civilization's development.

These adept packhunters only fashion tools; The only signifier of their human origin. Flint tools and crude stone crafts.

As disgusting as they are, I find an odd beauty in them. A near polar opposite of us.
