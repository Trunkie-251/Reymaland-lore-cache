### Autoassembler

This is the autofactory that the Magnate has control over, and gives him profits. He is cybernetically interconnected with it, meaning he can fabricate *anything* from any distance away. Due to the assembler being an advanced autofabrication plant, it needs no workers, *except* for a large maintenance crew who constantly maintain and repair the thing.

There is a vast complex of passages, ducting, and crawlspaces so low, one needs to go prone to crawl through them to repair machinery. Optimally, the autofactory should be off when it is being repaired and maintained, but that is usually not the case.

### Axlotl Tanks

The Axlotl Tanks, otherwise known the "Broodmother", is a bizarre meat-machine hybrid whose uterine lining gestate the organs, wetware, creatures, and posthumans needed to run the arcology. It is not sapient, but has some degree of animalistic awareness, capable of feeling pain when hurt (damaged).

The Genesmith takes care of the Axlotl tanks, for they are her forge which the chains of genetic material are forged into new biomods, wetware, and creatures.

The components of the Axlotl tanks are mostly organic, with a few mechanical parts which means repairing the thing requires parts produced by the *autoassembler*, if those cybernetic components break.

### Gene Garden

The Gene Garden serves as a archive of sorts for various genes and genetic materials of different plants and animals that are used for genetic tinkering 

### Genesmelter

The genemelter is an advanced facility which the long chains of DNA are smelted from their base links to create bio-mods and engineer the strands necessary to create new creatures and characters.
