Augmentery facilities are used to augment life-forms and graft components onto

### Autoassembler

This is the autofactory that the Magnate has control over, and gives him profits. He is cybernetically interconnected with it, meaning he can fabricate *anything* from any distance away. Due to the assembler being an advanced autofabrication plant, it needs no workers, *except* for a large maintenance crew who constantly maintain and repair the thing.

There is a vast complex of passages, ducting, and crawlspaces so low, one needs to go prone to crawl through them to repair machinery. Optimally, the autofactory should be off when it is being repaired and maintained, but that is usually not the case.

The Autoassembler is mostly synthetic, but comprises of a few organic components that are critical to it's function, like the Axlotl tank. The organic wetware produced by the genesmith's Axlotl tank are necessary to help repair hese organic parts.

### Axlotl Tanks

The Axlotl Tanks, otherwise known the "Broodmother", is a bizarre meat-machine hybrid whose uterine lining gestate the organs, wetware, creatures, and posthumans needed to run the arcology. It is not sapient, but has some degree of animalistic awareness, capable of feeling pain when hurt (damaged).

The Genesmith takes care of the Axlotl tanks, for they are her forge which the chains of genetic material are forged into new biomods, wetware, and creatures.

The components of the Axlotl tanks are mostly organic, with a few mechanical parts which means repairing the thing requires parts produced by the *autoassembler*, if those cybernetic components break.

### Gene Garden

The Gene Garden serves as a archive of sorts for various genes and genetic materials of different plants and animals that are used for genetic tinkering 

### Genesmelter

The genemelter is an advanced facility which the long chains of DNA are smelted from their base links to create bio-mods and engineer the strands necessary to create new creatures and characters.

### Mind Stem

Direct access to the Network node is done through here.

### Network Node

An interconnected network which is the backbone of the station's cyberspace. Necessary to exist if cyberspace is to exist and be interactable.

Cyberneticists connect to this and maintain it, besides messing around with various technologies.

### Recycling Tanks

Recycle emptied corpses whose bodies bodies have been harvest of all organs an augmentations into biomass and nutriment needed by the genesmith and the nutritionist (perhaps)

### Recycler

Used to recycle materials to be stored within the autoassembler and the fabrication network.
