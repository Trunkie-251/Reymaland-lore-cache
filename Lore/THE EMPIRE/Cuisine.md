# Cuisine:

#### Nutriment Paste:

Various flavours of reconstituted nutrient paste. These tend to be hyperefficient at getting you nutrition, although they can be flavourless.

Nutriment paste can take many forms; Solid gelatin-like bricks, liquid goop, drinkable fluid, etc.

#### Yeastbread:

A quick, cheap, and easy way to get nutrition. Essentially a yeastbread strain will be held in some variety of container, with a tad bit of water added. In a couple of minutes, it will grow into a bread-like yeast growth.

#### Aberrant flesh:

Assorted flesh detrius grown similiarly to a teratoma, though with only soft-body tissues such as organs or muscle. Hair and bones don't exist in Aberrant flesh.

Tends to be best eaten with heavy seasoning after being boiled. A favorite of the lizard underclasses.

#### Rat Bacon:

Bacon from "rats" (they are not rats). Very tasty.
