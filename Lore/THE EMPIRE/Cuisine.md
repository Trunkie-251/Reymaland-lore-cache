#### Aberrant flesh:

Assorted flesh detrius grown similiarly to a teratoma, though with only soft-body tissues such as organs or muscle. Hair and bones don't exist in Aberrant flesh.

Tends to be best eaten with heavy seasoning after being boiled. A favorite of the lizard underclasses.

#### Rat Bacon:

Bacon from "rats" (they are not rats). Very tasty.
