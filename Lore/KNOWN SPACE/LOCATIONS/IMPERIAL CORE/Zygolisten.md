* ### Trantor:

The homeworld of the lizards, and the imperial throneworld. Trantor itself a Ecumenopolis world, a planet whose entire surface is covered in vast megacities. Gigantic hivespires stretch from the 'surface' all the way to orbit serving as enormous foundational piles for vast orbital rings that serve as gigantic factories, shipyards, naval bases, and defenses.

* ### Hame:

One of two moons of Trantor. Just like Trantor itself, they are extensively industrialized and serve as support manufacturing hubs and as vast agriworlds covered in massive arcologies dedicated to growing yeastfood and synthmeat to feed Trantor's hungry maw.
