# Sol

* ### Venus

Has returned to its natural state as a literal *hell*. The system of orbital mirrors and vast terraforming machinery were destroyed when the Spacers tore through Earth's territories. People lived on Venus for decades after the destruction of the terraforming machinery, struggling to survive until they could not cope with the changing environment...

* ### Earth

A half-dead world, whom some of the only 'free' human life clings to in all of space. The vast uninhabitable zones and atomic gashes from when the Spacers bombarded the planet back into the iron age, still fester visibly from orbit. The huge concrete-and-plasteel skeletons of ancient metropolises still stand, albeit crumbling.

* ### Luna

The silent ruins of ancient arcologies and vast uranium stripmines lay quietly on the surface of the moon, perfectly preserved by the lack of corrosive atmosphere.

* ### Mars 

While the conditions on mars are harsh, Mars suffered less overall damage than earth, during the spacer invasion. The terraforming on Mars's surface will last for at least another thousand years without maintenance, even though conditions are already rather harsh.
