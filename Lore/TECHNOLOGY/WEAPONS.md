### Ballistic

Ancient bullet weapons. These days they tend to be completely caseless. Not as common as they used to be, but hey. They exist.

Ancient facilities and derelict voidships of human origin tend to have fabrication chips and armories full of these. 

The empire sometimes uses converted, partially altered human weapons in places where lower-end security is required. These versions tend to be brutalized human templates meshed with lizard technology and gun-parts, creating a weird hybrid of low and high tech.

### Needle

Caseless flechettes that shred through meat. Most modern ballistics are needlers of some variety, and they shred through meat like it's nothing.

These flechettes tend to mke up the majority of firearms nowadays, at least the ones that use caseless ammo.

### Laser

### Gauss

Gauss weapons fire large ferromagnetic slugs.

"An enforcer's best friend is a 5mm Gauss revolver" as the old saying goes.

### Volkite

One of the most common imperial energy weapons. It fires beams of intense heat, rather than the light lasers emit. While this does make it less penetrative in comparison to lasers, it emits enough thermal and infared radiation to set any exposed flesh ablaze.

Due to the sheer amount of heat that volkites emit, they can overheat easily, even though the gun has measures to prevent this. Constant use of the weapon may burn your hands if you are not wearing a suit of some variety.

There is an alternative version of the volkite which fires a lower-intensitely 'cone' of thermal radiation rather than a beam, creating a sort of 'shotgun' variant of the volkite.

Many veterans have the image of their comrades being burned alived by intense volkite fire branded into their minds for decades afterwards.

### Gamma-ray

Fires an intense beam of gamma-rays which vaporizes flesh into plasma instantly, and melts metal into slag. An unarmored target getting hit by a Gamma-ray, or a graser gun is like a mannequin made of c4 being detonated. Very messy.

Due to the intensity of the beam, looking at it without eye protection will cause permanent damage to the corneas of the eyes, and will cause cheap cyberoptics to burn out. Standard cybereyes are immune to the effects.

The weapon emits quite a bit of radiation when fired. The target, if they survive will definitely *not* be having children ever again, from the sheer amount of gamma-rays that have sliced through their body. Additionally, if the weapon doesn't kill (somehow), the target will usualy die from the intense radiation damage, and the death of their white-blood cells due to acute DNA damage.

This weapon is only used by the blessed machines, and the occasional cyborg, as the radiation emitted from the gun *itself* makes it completely unusable for organics.

Glory to the Triarchs, Glory to the Empress!!!!

### Flayer

Weird weapon based on bizarre and esoteric Nether-Mechanics. It molecularly disassembles its target by breaking apart the molecular bonds that which keep them together. Armor and cover do not protect from it at all, as the flayer only takes a few extra microseconds to demolecularize those into ash and nethermatter.

Power supply is an issue with this weapon, seeing use only in top-secret combat synthetics with modified reactor-units, or on unmarked stealth vehicles such as 'Black Agravs'.

The wounds which are created are terrible in nature, as there's no way you can suture a gaping hole missing bone, muscle, and potentially organs that were disintegrated. Additionally the wet mass and fused nethermatter usually cause infections if the victim does not die from bleeding out. Extended use of a flayer on a target usually leads to the target looking like a block of swiss cheese afterwards.

This weapon is a state secret, used exclusively by a few black-ops synthetics of the Triarchs, and the Empress. Non-imperial versions have been found to be used by [REDACTED] in campaigns of [DATA EXPUNGED].
