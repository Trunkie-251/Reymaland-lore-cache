# Szzara

### Description:

A race of reptillian humanoids originating from earth...

Conan and his armies defeated the Szzara long ago in the *Hyborian Age*, wiping the Szzara off from the face of hypoborea, andforcing the Szzara into hiding through the use of bizarre alien biotech to hide amongst mankind's civilizations.

Before the Cataclysm, Szzara Matriarchs had their claws sunk into almost the entirety of human civilization, their various 'clans' serving as the 'true' de-facto superpowers of earth. A shadow government of sorts.

Nowadays the Szzara are the (of the empire), and no longer are in hiding. Humanity and the lizards are now forced to rely on one-another.

### Physiology:

Szzara stand at about 2.1 meters in height. Females have far more muscle mass and a tougher skeletal system compared to males. Szzara are physically powerful, with females are far stronger than the average human. 

Around the thyroid in the neck are a pair of venom glands which connect to several of the Szzara's teeth. They are evolutionary holdovers from when the Szzara were proper packhunters. The venom itself is injected through the teeth, and paralyzes prey once there is enough in the bloodstream.

Szzara have redundant organs. They also have longer lifespans at about ~200 years on average.

IDEAS: 

* Szzara are either a species that evolved side-by-side to humanity, or are a subspecies, or mayhaps are the result of weird tinkering with genesplicing and other weird biotechnology.

* Lizard males are affected by pheromones. Maybe due to this, there's some weird form of hive structure within Szzara society?
