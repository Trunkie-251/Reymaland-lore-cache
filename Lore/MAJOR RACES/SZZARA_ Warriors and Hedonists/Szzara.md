# Szzara

### Description:

### Physiology:

Szzara stand at about 2.1 meters in height. Females have far more muscle and a tougher skeletal system compared to males. Szzara are physically powerful, with females are far stronger than the average human. 

Around the thyroid in the neck are a pair of venom glands which connect to several of the Szzara's teeth. They are evolutionary holdovers from when the Szzara were proper packhunters. The venom itself is injected through the teeth, and paralyzes prey once there is enough in the bloodstream.
