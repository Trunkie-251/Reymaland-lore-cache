# Synthetics

### Description:

Artificial race created by vast Machine-gods.

### Physiology:

Synthetics are advanced nanotechnological robots. Powerful machines who are capable of walking through the irradiated heart of a reactor, or sitting naked upon the skin of a voidship. Or walking across the surfaces of inhospitable worlds under alien suns.

In short; They are *durable*, radiation-proof, immune to temperatures ranging from -271c to 2,000c, do not need to breath, and feel no pain at all. They have no blood, therefore do not bleed. The only way to truly 'kill' them is to damage/destroy the positronic brain in some way.
