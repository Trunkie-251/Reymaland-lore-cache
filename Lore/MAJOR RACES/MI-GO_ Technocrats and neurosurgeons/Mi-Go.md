# Mi-Go

### Description:

The Mi-Go are fungi from Yuggoth, a bizarre world shrouded in near-eternal darkness on the edge of the solar system.

They have been visiting earth since mid 1930s, until the cataclysm.

They abandoned their colony on outpost in the himalayas (and by extension ALL their activities on earth.) after the awakening of Cthulhu and the return of the Starspawn from their ancient sleep in the necropolis R'yleh.

They have roughly the same level of technology as the Empire, albeit with a different technological path in comparison to the imperials.

### Physiology:

Completely inhuman. These creatures are comprised of a fungal tissue, with the form akin to a large crustacean. Fungal tissue melds with a insectoid-ish anatomy.

Mi-go fungal-carapace is weird and semi-transluscent, capable of allowing them to disappear entirely from sight. A weird side-effect of this, is that the mi-go do not appear in photographs due to how unnatural their physiology is. Synthetics may or may not be completely blind to the Mi-Go.
