# The Allayi

### Description:

The Allayi are a human subspecies who diverged back during the Cataclysm, as one of the Cryosleeper voidships that had managed to escape the catastrophe on earth, which mankind was taught new ways to shout and kill, becoming things like the old ones; Beyond good and evil.

Nowadays the Allayi travel as nomads in one of their many *Clan Fleets*, vast armadas consisting of hundreds of ships; ranging miniscule suborbital shuttles, to vast arkships and factory vessels, and everything in between. Fleets themselves are vast...

Typically, Allayi ships are 'jacks of all trades', capable of filling any role but having a few specialties they focus on. Just like their ships, Allayi crews are the exact same way-- Generally at least *capable* of filling most tasks, tightly-knit together into... The Allayi unknowingly take many cultural traits from the Hyborian age...

Allayi are seen in imperial space generally as mercenaries who sell out their services as powerful voidborne warriors and technicians who fight for the highest bidder.

# Physiology:

Physiologically-speaking, Allayi are furred mammalians that stand at about 1.9 meters tall on average. They have a fur coat that ranges from snow-white, to deep midnight black, and everything in between. The musculoskeletal system of the Allayi is frail and survives poorly under gravity, essentially forcing them to live in zero-g.

When required to to operate in areas of low-g, planetary gravity wells, and... What few ground vehicles the spacers utilize have their cockpits encased in vast amounts of grav-cushioning and padding. Furthermore, they physically don skintight gel exoskeletons which fit snugly to the body. This serves as physical support for the body in areas with high gravity.

Internal organs are a bit different. The digestion system isn't as capable as other species, meaning raw meat and some naturally-grown foodtypes will actually cause immediate food poisoning. Synthetic food such as yeast-based synthetics and artificial meat do not cause this problem. Allayi have do not actually have hearts, but instead a decentralized network of blood-pumping muscles located throughout the body.

By default, Allayi have near-perfect vision in 3-D spaces, and almost have no sense of up or down. They have damn-near-perfect vision, and can see in the dark. Due to this, they are relatively susceptible to bright flashes if they do not have lense implants.

Allayi Philosophy on augmentations are very different from the imperial norm. Instead of the bio-cybernetic horrors that prowl the dark hivecities of the empire, those in Deep space use far more 'subtle' augmentations, namely advanced micro-machines and internal prosthetic organs. Chiefly of these are the *Clan markings* and the *Autoimmune system*. The Autoimmune system is a synthetic pump, much like a heart that produces micromachines and filters blood. It also serves as the means of control for the micromachines in an Allayi's body, as it is directly grafted into the spinal cord.

### Trivia:

* Allayi time is not measured in days, but in 5-hour 'shifts'. Four shifts make up a "Day", and (number of days) makes up a (quadrum). A 'Year' is split into four quadrums.

* Allayi infantry exclusively use powered armour.

* Allayi are adept at traversing the industrial cyber-nightmare that are their ships, giving them unmatched prowess in navigating the vast bellies of starships, to planetside urban combat zones within imperial hivecities. This ability is only matched by *ratlings*, another human subspecies typically seen in underhive zones.

### Notes:

* Allayi spacers in gameplay should be extremely *weak*. A good punch to the torso should shatter bones, falls and slips should always lead to fractures. This forces them to either fight almost always at *range*, or as power armour and mecha pilots.
