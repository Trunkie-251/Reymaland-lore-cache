# Humanikatari

### Description:

Humanikatari in its traditional form stopped existing long, *long* before the events of the current setting.

### Subspecies:

#### Troglodyte

Disgustingly pale ruin-haunters. They are incredibly inbred, and the only vestiges of non-imperial humanikatari that exist outside of the already rare baseliner population which is in the *thousands*

#### ?? No.1

Bio-engineered post-human template that tends to be modified with cybernetics to better fit the roles they are needed for.

The baseline playable template for humanikatari.

Despite everything, they're arguably still human, as humanity comes with *mind*, not body.

#### ??? No.2

Heavier bio-engineered template that is larger and bulkier.

#### ??? No.3

More specialized and fragile bio-engineered template.

#### Baseliner

Non-existent outside of the occasional cryogenic sarcophagus containing a living individual. Not playable by normal means.

In the entirety of the universe there are approximately ~4000 baseliners in existence with about 70% of them cryogenically frozen in a drifting sleeper-ship in the Unthinking Depths.
